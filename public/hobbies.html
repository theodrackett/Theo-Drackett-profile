    <h1>THINGS I LIKE TO DO</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Learning is my number one. I love to learn!</li>
        <li>Hitting the gym is a strong second.</li>
        <li>Like everyone else, I love to travel!</li>
        <li>I love to read.</li>
        <li>And play video games. As a matter of fact, I used to own a vides game store.</li>
        <li>I also love coding. I actually wrote an app in both SWIFT and Kotlin that actually <br>
            made to their respective app store and sold a few copies. Yes, only a few. I suck at marketing.</li>
        <li>And finally, I love to write. I actually wrote a book called "Uncle Sam I Want My Money Back Mon!". 
            Please don't read it. It's kind of embarrassing.
