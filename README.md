# Theo Drackett
ðŸ”­ I am dedicated to continuous improvement, a concept ingrained in me during my time at a manufacturing company in college where we embraced the Japanese principle of KAIZEN.

ðŸ‘¯ As a tech enthusiast, I'm keen to collaborate on innovative projects involving Python, JavaScript or Java, my programming languages of choice.

ðŸ“« For professional inquiries, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn (insert LinkedIn profile link).

âš¡ Fun fact: 'Yawdie' is a term in Jamaican Patois for Jamaican.

ðŸ‘¯ About me: I am a seasoned QA Automation Engineer with 20 years of experience in software testing. My technical journey has included numerous languages, operating systems, and tools, with Python being my top pick, closely followed by Java.

ðŸ”­ I'm the founder of Street Vendor Helper, an app designed to assist street vendors in locating and rating vending opportunities. I welcome your input and collaboration on this project! (Include a link to the project if available)
